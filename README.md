### Screen Recording

### Requirements

1. A tab bar controller that displays two view controllers:
	- A view controller that allows the user to add new movies
	- A view controller that shows all the movie that have been created. This movie list view controller is implemented using a subclass of `UIViewController`, **not** `UITableViewController`.
2. The view controller that shows the list of movies uses a custom `UITableViewCell` that displays the movie's title and has a button to toggle whether the user has seen the movie or not. The button's text reflects whether the movie is seen or not.
3. User can swipe to delete movies.

#### Extra Challenges

- Add functionality to let the user to search for movies.
- Sort the movies alphabetically.
